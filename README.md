## Data harmonization for cross-cohort aging research

This folder contains data harmonization code developed as part of the **Non-Fracture Fall Injuries and Long-Term Geriatric Consequences Cross-Cohort Study**.

The code documents the process of harmonizing longitudinal data across four large U.S. aging cohorts: **Health ABC, CHS, MrOS, and WHI-LLS**, with a focus on fall-related outcomes, body composition phenotypes, and geriatric health indicators.

### Key objectives

- Standardizing variable definitions and coding across cohorts  
- Aligning measurement time scales and visit structures  
- Generating harmonized analytic variables for cross-cohort analyses  
- Supporting reproducible longitudinal and survival analyses of fall-related outcomes
